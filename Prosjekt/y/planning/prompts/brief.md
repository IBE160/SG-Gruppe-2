# BMAD Brief â€“ AI Study Buddy

## Background
Students often spend a significant amount of time summarizing and creating study materials manually. This is inefficient, especially for large syllabi. AI can assist by generating summaries, flashcards, and quizzes from uploaded course notes.

## Goal
Develop a prototype application called **AI Study Buddy** that helps students prepare for exams by processing course materials into usable learning aids.

## Scope
- Input: Uploaded course material (PDF/text), user preferences.
- Output: Summaries, flashcards, quizzes, key term lists.
- Platform: Simple web-based prototype.
- Users: Higher education students.

## Key Features
- Upload notes
- Generate summaries
- Generate flashcards
- Generate quizzes with answers
- List of key concepts

## Constraints
- Must be deliverable within the semester.
- Focus on functionality rather than perfect UI.
- Prompt documentation must be saved as part of the project.

## Success Criteria
- The application runs locally and produces summaries, flashcards, and quizzes from a sample input.
- All BMAD documentation (designer, developer, tester, scrummaster) is complete.
- Prompts are stored and reproducible.
