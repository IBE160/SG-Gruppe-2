Project Code and Title
IBE160 â€“ Programming with AI
Project Title: AI Study Buddy

Overview
The AI Study Buddy is an application designed to help students process their course material more effectively. By using artificial intelligence, the system can generate summaries, flashcards, and quiz questions based on uploaded lecture notes or study materials. The goal is to give students a concrete tool for learning and exam preparation, while also providing us as developers with practical experience in text processing and AI integration.

Problem Statement
Students often spend a significant amount of time summarizing notes and creating learning materials manually. This process is inefficient, especially when the syllabus is extensive. There is a clear need for a digital assistant that can help students structure their study work and reduce repetitive tasks.

Objectives
Develop an AI-powered application that supports students in learning and exam preparation.
Implement functionality for creating summaries, flashcards, and quiz questions from uploaded content.
Learn how AI can be integrated into real applications and how to handle basic security and privacy considerations.
Functionality
Input: Uploaded course material (PDF/text), user preferences (level of detail, language, number of questions).
Output: Summaries, flashcards (Q&A format), quizzes with answers, key concept lists.
Optional: Login functionality if users want to save their materials.
Key Features
Upload lecture notes or course material.
Generate summaries of different lengths.
Create flashcards for active recall.
Generate quizzes with answer keys.
Provide a list of key terms from the text.
Data and Processing
Data In: PDF or text files from studentsâ€™ notes or course material.
Data Out: Summaries, flashcards, quiz questions, and key terms.
Decisions:
Choice of LLM (Large Language Model).
Granularity of summaries.
Quiz type (multiple choice vs open-ended).
Handling of tables/figures.
Local vs cloud-based processing.
Security and Privacy
Notes may contain protected course material â†’ privacy is important.
Possible use of anonymization or encrypted storage.
Login only required if data is stored for later use.
Complexity
Difficulty Level: ðŸŸ¢ Simple
Requires basic text processing, AI integration, and a simple user interface.
Can be extended with more advanced features (adaptive quizzes, study progress tracking).
Expected Learning Outcomes
Gain experience with AI-based text generation.
Understand how to integrate AI models into a web application.
Learn to handle user data and basic privacy/security issues.
Improve skills in interface design and interactive learning tools.
Summary:
AI Study Buddy is a manageable but meaningful project. It has a low technical threshold, fits well within the time frame, and provides strong learning outcomes by combining programming, AI integration, and user-focused design.
