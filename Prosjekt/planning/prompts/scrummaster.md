## Risk Analysis

**Prompt:**  
Identify potential risks (e.g., time shortage, API errors, data privacy) and propose mitigation strategies.

**AI Response:**  
- **Time Shortage:**  
  - Mitigation: Prioritize core features, maintain clear weekly goals, and hold regular check-ins.
- **API Errors or Downtime:**  
  - Mitigation: Implement error handling, use fallback messages, and test with mock data.
- **Data Privacy Concerns:**  
  - Mitigation: Avoid storing sensitive data, use environment variables for API keys, and recommend HTTPS for deployment.
- **Team Communication Issues:**  
  - Mitigation: Schedule regular meetings, use shared documentation, and clarify responsibilities early.
