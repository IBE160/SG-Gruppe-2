# Designer Role – AI Study Buddy

## Vision
Create an accessible, student-focused interface that is easy to use, visually clear, and inclusive. The design should be inspired by Norwegian government digital services, emphasizing simplicity, accessibility, and compliance with WCAG standards. The application must be approachable for students of all backgrounds and abilities, with a logical flow from uploading materials to reviewing generated study aids.

## Responsibilities
- Design intuitive layouts for uploading notes, displaying results, and adjusting settings.
- Develop a minimalistic, modern user interface with a focus on clarity and accessibility.
- Ensure navigation is smooth and logical: upload → results → settings/options.
- Select a color palette, fonts, and icons that enhance readability and are accessible to all users.
- Document accessibility considerations, including color contrast, font size, and keyboard navigation.

## Deliverables
- Wireframes or sketches of main screens (upload, results, settings).
- Style guide (color palette, fonts, icons).
- Accessibility notes and recommendations.
